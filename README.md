## **Patterns and Examples**

### **1. Sliding Window**
The Sliding Window pattern helps solve problems involving subarrays or substrings by maintaining a window over part of the data.  
**When to use:**  
- Linear data structures (e.g., arrays, strings, linked lists).  
- Problems asking for longest/shortest subarray or a specific value.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (Easy)  
- Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (Medium)  

---

### **2. Two Pointers**
This pattern uses two pointers to traverse a data structure in tandem, optimizing problems involving comparisons or searching pairs.  
**When to use:**  
- Sorted arrays or linked lists.  
- Problems involving pairs or subarrays.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Squaring a Sorted Array (Easy)  
- Triplets that Sum to Zero (Medium)  

---

### **3. Fast and Slow Pointers**
Also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, this pattern is ideal for detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.  
**When to use:**  
- Cyclic loops in data structures.  
- Palindrome detection in linked lists.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Linked List Cycle (Easy)  
- Palindrome Linked List (Medium)  

---

### **4. Merge Intervals**
Efficiently handle overlapping intervals by merging or finding intersections.  
**When to use:**  
- Problems mentioning "overlapping intervals."  
**Example Problems:**  
- Merge Overlapping Intervals (Medium)  
- Maximum CPU Load (Hard)  

---

### **5. Cyclic Sort**
This pattern solves problems involving arrays with elements in a specific range by iterating and swapping until elements are in their correct positions.  
**When to use:**  
- Sorted/rotated arrays with missing/duplicate numbers.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Find Missing Number (Easy)  
- Find the Smallest Missing Positive Number (Medium)  

---

### **6. In-Place Reversal of Linked List**
Reverse links between nodes in a linked list without using extra memory.  
**When to use:**  
- Problems requiring reversal of linked lists in-place.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Reverse a Sub-list (Medium)  
- Reverse Every K-element Sub-list (Medium)  

---

### **7. Tree BFS**
Use a queue for level-order traversal of trees.  
**When to use:**  
- Level-by-level tree traversal.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (Easy)  
- Zigzag Traversal (Medium)  

---

### **8. Tree DFS**
Depth-first traversal of trees using recursion or a stack.  
**When to use:**  
- In-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal of trees.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Sum of Path Numbers (Medium)  
- All Paths for a Sum (Medium)  

---

### **9. Two Heaps**
Use Min and Max Heaps to efficiently handle problems involving two distinct groups.  
**When to use:**  
- Finding medians or smallest/largest elements in a group.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Median of a Number Stream (Medium)  

---

### **10. Subsets**
Solve problems requiring combinations or permutations of a given set using a BFS approach.  
**When to use:**  
- Finding subsets, combinations, or permutations.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Subsets with Duplicates (Easy)  
- String Permutations by Changing Case (Medium)  

---

### **11. Modified Binary Search**
Optimize searches in sorted data using binary search.  
**When to use:**  
- Problems involving sorted arrays or matrices.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Search in a Sorted Infinite Array (Medium)  

---

### **12. Top K Elements**
Find the top/smallest/frequent K elements efficiently using heaps.  
**When to use:**  
- Finding top/smallest/frequent elements.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Top K Numbers (Easy)  
- Top K Frequent Numbers (Medium)  

---

### **13. K-Way Merge**
Merge or traverse K sorted arrays efficiently using heaps.  
**When to use:**  
- Problems involving sorted arrays or lists.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Merge K Sorted Lists (Medium)  

---

### **14. Topological Sort**
Find a linear ordering of elements with dependencies.  
**When to use:**  
- Graph problems without cycles.  
**Example Problems:**  
- Task Scheduling (Medium)
